# Sample using ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
This repository contains a sample that uses the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Javascript version 4.25.

This sample uses the statistics query by defining the [outStatistics](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-support-Query.html#outStatistics) parameter and displays the results of the query in a chart. 

This application shows the Mongolian population range from 1990 to 2013. The population is queried by gender and years, and is displayed in a bar chart.
